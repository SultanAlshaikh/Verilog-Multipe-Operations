# Verilog-Multipe-Operations
 performs addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and Exclusive OR (XOR) the output is in 7-segment display for the operands A (4-bit long) and B (4-bit long)

An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and Exclusive OR (XOR) is needed to be designed, the output and input should be displayed on a 7-segment display for the operands A (4-bit long) and B (4-bit long) using Logisim and Verilog
